I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Computer Science & Engineering ](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/) at University of California Riverside(UCR), Where I work with [Dr. Zhijia Zhao](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhijia/). My research spans the intersection of *software engineering, programming languages, and mobile systems*, I explore ideas from each and apply them on automatic detection, optimization, prevention, and mitigation of issues in software. I regularly publish in top conferences, including MobiSys, ASPLOS, and OOPSLA.

My research has been recognized with a _[Best Paper Runner-up Award](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2018/papers/)_ @ MobiSys'18 and _[ACM SIGMOBILE Research Highlights (2018)](https://beta.sigmobile.org/articles/research-highlights)_. 
<!-- Prior to that, I worked as Software Engineer at multiple companies where I worked on Mobile Apps & Games design and development. I have received my undergraduate degree from Virtual University of Pakistan, Lahore. )-->
