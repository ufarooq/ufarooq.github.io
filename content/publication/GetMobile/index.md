abstract: "Portable devices, like smartphones and tablets, are often subject to higher frequency of configuration changes, such as screen orientation changes, screen resizing, keyboard attachments, and language switching. Since the changes can happen at runtime while users interact with the devices, they are referred to as runtime changes. Recent studies have shown that runtime changes happen regularly as users operate their apps. For example, on average, users change the orientation of their devices every five minutes accumulatively over sessions of the same app [1]. For multilingual or tablet users, changing the language setting or attaching an external keyboard is often desired. As newer versions of Android systems with multiwindow supports are adopted, it is projected that runtime changes will happen more frequently. Each time a user drags the boundary between two split windows, a runtime change would be triggered."
