      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D Candidate in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering Department at University of California at Riverside, Where I work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhijia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Zhijia Zhao&lt;/a&gt;. My research has been recognized with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2018/papers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Best Paper Runner-up Award&lt;/a&gt; @ MobiSys&amp;rsquo;18 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.sigmobile.org/articles/research-highlights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ACM SIGMOBILE Research Highlights (2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research interests lie broadly in mobile systems and applications, with a focus on designing and applying program analysis and refactoring techniques to address real-world issues in the mobile systems and applications. Prior to that, I worked as Software Engineer at multiple companies where I worked on Mobile Apps &amp;amp; Games design and development. I have received my undergraduate degree from Virtual University of Pakistan Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
